          <p>
            We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
            selling mangos. We know what a good mango looks like and how they
            are grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy
            soil that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper
            drainage and aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in 
            Uttar Pradesh which is proudly known as paradise of earth is also home to
            temperate fruits like mango for which the state is very famous
            across globe. India contributes to 50% of the total world’s mango production.
           Uttar Pradesh is India’s largest Mango producing state, 
           producing 4 million tonnes of Mango every year. 
           Mango is a nutritious food and has huge health benefits.
           Mango is also preferred in various food processing industries because of its nutritional value.
           Mango is a rich source of Vitamin A and Vitamin C.
           A good mango variety contains 20% of total soluble sugars.
            Mango fruit has an acidic level ranging from 0.2 to 0.5% and a protein content of about 1%.
